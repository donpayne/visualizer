# Visualizer

## Getting Started

Download the files in this repository and unzip [https://github.com/donpayne/visualizer/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/donpayne/visualizer/archive/master.zip).

You can just open the .html file in a browser. Opening files in a browser is a bit of a security risk, so your browser (ie, Chrome) may not run all of the Javascript.

You can also run a simple webserver so that it behaves like a typical web application. This will avert the issues with security. To do this, go to [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) to download and install Node.js for your system. Install the latest version with all of the defaults.

Then from the directory you saved the repository files to, run the following command from a terminal window:

```
> node app.js
```

Click the canvas to start!
